# GAN-Practice
My attempt at implementing basic GAN architectures in both Keras and PyTorch.

## Description
The repository contains code of me tinkering around in PyTorch, mostly involving replicating a Keras model. Some parts of the code aren't really documented well as it mostly involved me figuring out tiny details. Overall, working on GANs helped me understand common issues that develop regarding convergence of the training losses involved. However, understanding this code can lay a good foundation for one's further implementations of a complex GAN architecture.

## Dependencies
* Keras 2.3.1
* PyTorch 1.4.0
* Python 3.7.6
